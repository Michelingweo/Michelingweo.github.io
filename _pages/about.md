Hi, my name is Liwei Che. I obtained my master's degree in informatics from Penn State and my bachelor's degree in electronic information engineering from the University of Glasgow with the highest honor(1st class degree) and a dual degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

My research interests mainly lie in Efficient Learning, Federated Learning and Multi-modal Learning.
